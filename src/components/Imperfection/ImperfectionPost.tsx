      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;This is what we call ordinary.</p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Yet where should beauty be found if not in banality, in the fleeting gestures
        and repetitive rhythms of daily life that fade so far into the background that they become
        workaday, unlovely â€“ in a word, imperfect?
      </p>
      <p>
        We tend to think of beauty as flawless. Yet perfection is often so perfect, it becomes
        bland.
      </p>
      <p>
        A hymn to human ingenuity in a land where machines are not yet king, where life still has
        soul.
